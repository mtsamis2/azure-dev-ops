# Lesson 3

## Exercise 1:

It’s finally time to deploy some code to Azure! Clone the Flask Python Application provided here.

Once you have the code, deploy it as a Linux app service to the “resource-group-west” resource group. Afterwards, open the web server log using Azure CLI and confirm that you see an output.

Prerequisites:
-	A GitHub Account. If you don’t have one, create one here: https://github.com/
-	Azure CLI. Follow the instructions here if you have not installed it yet: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest

Note: Azure free account only allows 1 Linux App Service of size F1. You will need to delete the App Service along with the App Service Plan after this exercise since we will create other Linux App Services throughout this course.
